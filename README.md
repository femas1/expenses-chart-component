This is a solution to the [Expenses chart component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt). 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

- Getting data from local json file using the fetch method
- Toggling classList of an Element based on getting a sibling (Element.previousElemetSibling)
